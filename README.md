# Data Skills Bootcamp

Week 1

In week 1, I learned how to use formulas in Excel which will allow me to
analyse and visualise data which helps me to clearly show the results I
am looking for, and I also learned about data laws & regulations.

One of my tasks, I was asked to create a pivot table showcasing students
average and highest scores. I was then able to create a table that
showcased the results of the top preforming students. Excel cannot hold
very large datasets, so it is useful when using locally and for smaller
or internal data from an organisation. This task allowed me to use
formulas such as 'SUM, 'AVERAGE' and 'SWITCH'.

Week 2

Week 2 consisted of learning how to use Tableau and PowerBI, these two
platforms are effective when creating dashboards and taking a deeper
dive into large datasets for business insights. With the use of the
tools on PowerBI, I was able to analyse a Spotify dataset, which
produced results showing the most popular genres and artists, also I was
able to create a scatter graph showing the results of the correlation
between the average loudness of a song and popularity.

Week 3

In the third week I have dived into SQL (Structed Query Language), this
software here helps the user to store, organise and retrieve from a
database easily. I was taught important terms used to get results from
the software and, I learned about primary and foreign keys, what makes
these keys so important is that it helps with data modelling and making
sure that I can connect tables and retrieve the relevant information to
get the output I want. In addition, data is updated regularly for
example, in a e-com store they will need their sales table updated, as
well as delivery table updated so with the use of Primary and Foreign
keys, the tables can connect, and the corresponding table will be
updated to show pending or delivered status and update the stock list.

Week 4

In week 4, I worked with cloud computing and Microsoft Azure. I learned
the differences between IaaS, PaaS and SaaS, and explored how
organisations deploy cloud solutions for scalability and security. I
also practised using Azure SQL Database, Azure Blob Storage and Azure
Data Factory, which helped me understand how data pipelines operate in
modern analytics environments and I gained an understanding of how to
model and mine relational and non-relational databases.

Week 5

Week 5 introduced Python programming for data analysis. I learned how to
load CSV files using pandas, clean and transform data, create new
calculated fields, and export results. I also practised grouping and
aggregating data, creating pivot-style summaries in code, and completed
challenges using functions such as 'FOR', 'IF', 'ELSE' and 'ELIF' to
strengthen programming fundamentals.
